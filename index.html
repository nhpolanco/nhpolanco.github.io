		<p> Nick Polanco is a 22 year old originally from Brooklyn, NY. If you enjoy hikes, good reads, or broad-minded brainstorms [as you wander through creative spaces] he would love to explore with you. He usually finds his daydreams to be productive and his greatest ideas come to him in odd hours and random places. After studying biochemistry (with a sprinkling of Java &#38; Python) and working in development for a consumer science firm, he's looking to shift into a fast-paced and challenging environment.  He brings a diversity of thought, a complex understanding of systems, and a passion for efficiency with him wherever he goes; and if that isn't enough, his mother's family hails from a small fishing village in the Peloponnese, so he definitely knows about good food, good wine, and swimming in the Aegean!
